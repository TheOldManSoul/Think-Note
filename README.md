Think Note "README" 

The base idea of the project mainly explains itself,
the idea is just a To-DO list that keeps a record of tasks
so that if you cannot recall something correctly then looking
at the date and time it was completed or failed may help,

But i am also not against this idea being improved or even
made much more up to current standards in terms of ease of
use or compatability with other things, i am not really a
Code writer myself and so this was essentially my limit
currently skill wise, 

So please feel free to use it to your hearts content and
if anything is improved or such, i wish to be let know
it it. :)
